This is a high-converting agency website built for selling AI Agent services to GoHighLevel users.

## 🚀 Run Online For Free (Best Options)

Since you are using a Chromebook/Cloud IDE, here are the best ways to run this without crashing:

### Option 1: Live Deployment (Recommended)
This hosts your site permanently for free.
- **Vercel:** [Click to Deploy](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FH7Hasnain%2Fvillage)
- **Netlify:** Drag and drop the `out` folder (see below) to Netlify Drop.

### Option 2: Lightweight Preview (Low Memory)
If `npm run dev` keeps crashing your browser/IDE, use this "Static Preview" mode which uses 90% less memory:

1. Open Terminal
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
3. Click the link it gives you (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
